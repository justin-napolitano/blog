Creating a personal blog is a rite of passage for many developers. It’s an opportunity to share thoughts, showcase projects, and even document my coding journey. Welcome to my GitHub repository, [blog](https://github.com/justin-napolitano/blog). Let me walk you through what it is, why I built it, and the tech choices I made along the way.

## What the Repo Is

At its core, this repo is my personal website and blog. I built it using Hugo, a powerful static site generator. The choice to use Hugo came down to its speed and flexibility. I wanted a fast site that I could easily customize while spending minimal time wrestling with backend systems. 

The blog supports rich markdown formatting, easy integration of social media links, and features like pagination and syntax highlighting. It’s designed to make my content shine without the clutter.

## Why It Exists

I’ve always believed in the importance of sharing knowledge. Every time I learn something new or tackle a tricky problem, I want to document it. This repo serves as my online diary for those thoughts, experiments, and projects. 

Over time, I realized that blogging also helps solidify my own understanding. Explaining concepts to others forces me to break down complex ideas into digestible pieces. Plus, having a personal blog gives me a space to play with web technologies that interest me.

## Key Design Decisions

When crafting this project, I had a few non-negotiables in mind:

- **Modularity**: I wanted to keep the structure clean. That’s why I separated content into distinct folders like `posts`, `about`, and `projects`. 
- **Theming**: I chose multiple themes (`hugo-coder`, `hugo-shortcodes`) to give me visual flexibility. I love customizing my layout while keeping the focus on the content.
- **User Experience**: Dark and light color schemes with toggle support were non-negotiables. It’s 2023, and users should have the option to view things as they prefer.

## Stack and Tools

Here's what I decided to use to get this project off the ground:

- **Hugo**: The backbone of the entire setup. It builds static sites quickly and efficiently.
- **HTML/CSS/SCSS**: Simple tools for styling. I’ve got a few custom styles in there that help my blog stand out.
- **Python**: This handles build automation via a script. It’s a handy utility for streamlining my deployment.
- **JavaScript**: Just a bit of it for theme toggling and enhancing the UI without getting bogged down.

## Tradeoffs

Every tech stack has its compromises. With Hugo and static site generation, I traded dynamic content for speed. That said, it fits my needs perfectly. I don’t need real-time database queries for my blog; I need a responsive, fast loading experience.

Using multiple themes can also complicate things. While it offers flexibility, it can introduce layout inconsistencies. If you go this route, make sure you have a plan for testing across different themes.

## Future Work / Roadmap

Here’s what’s swirling around in my head as I think about the next steps for this blog:

- **Automated Deployment**: I want to enhance my build pipeline. Continuous deployment would be a game changer.
- **Theme Accessibility**: Improving accessibility features is crucial. I want my site to be usable by everyone.
- **Interactive Content**: I’m thinking of ways to integrate more dynamic content types. Maybe some JavaScript-driven components would add value.
- **Documentation**: I need to beef up my documentation for developers who want to contribute. Good onboarding is key.
- **Continuous Integration**: Testing the build process automatically is another box to check. It’ll help catch issues before they become problems.

## Wrapping Up

With all that said, I’m stoked about this blog. It’s not just a platform for my ideas but also a space for growth, exploration, and experimentation. If you’re interested in the nitty-gritty details or updates, make sure to follow me on social media—I'm sharing progress on Mastodon, Bluesky, and Twitter/X.
